### 3. CEO's Report - Marcus Thorne

Mr. Thorne presented the Q2 2025 overview. Key highlights:
* **Market Position:** We have maintained our #2 market share position in the North American logistics software sector.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** Initial talks with German firm "Logistik Automaten GmbH" for European market entry are progressing slower than anticipated.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Thorne noted the recent public announcement of the acquisition of LogiCore by TechGiant Corp for an estimated $1.2 billion. This poses a significant competitive threat that requires a strategic response.

### 4. Financial Review - Sofia Chen

Ms. Chen presented the preliminary Q2 2025 financial results.
* **Revenue:** Q2 Revenue was $150M, a 12% increase YoY, but 3% below the internal forecast of $155M. The shortfall is attributed to delays in the "Project Nova" rollout.
* **Net Profit Margin:** The net profit margin stands at a healthy 18%.
* **R&D Spending:** R&D investment was increased to $25M for the quarter, primarily allocated to the 'Project Chimera' initiative.
* **Forecast:** The Q3 forecast is projected at $165M, contingent on the successful launch of Nova's phase two.

Ms. Grant raised a concern about the increasing R&D burn rate relative to revenue growth. Ms. Chen clarified that the investment in Chimera is front-loaded.

**Action Item AI-2025-06-01:** Sofia Chen is to prepare a revised Q4 forecast including best-case and worst-case scenarios related to the European expansion. This report is due by July 15, 2025.

### 5. Technology and Product Roadmap - Ben Carter

Mr. Carter provided an update on key technology initiatives.
* **Project Nova:** Phase one is complete. Phase two deployment is scheduled for July 1, 2025.
* **Project Chimera:** This is the primary topic. Chimera is a next-generation AI-driven logistics prediction engine. Carter presented the proof-of-concept, demonstrating a 25% improvement in predictive accuracy over existing models.
* **Data Governance:** Carter noted that for Project Chimera to comply with international standards, its data processing protocols must be fully aligned with regulations like the European Union's AI Act. He confirmed his team is actively working on this.

A lengthy discussion on the strategic importance and potential risks of Project Chimera followed. Ms. Grant expressed concerns regarding the ethical implications of the AI's data sourcing, while Mr. Lee questioned the total addressable market size.

**Decision:** A motion was put forward by Marcus Thorne to formally approve the budget for the full-scale development of Project Chimera, with a total allocated budget of $75M over the next 24 months.
* **Motion Seconded by:** Ben Carter
* **Vote:**
    * For: 5 (Reed, Thorne, Chen, Carter, Lee)
    * Against: 1 (Grant)
* **Resolution:** The motion was carried. **It is resolved that Project Chimera is approved for full-scale development.**

**Action Item AI-2025-06-02:** Ben Carter must form a dedicated "AI Ethics & Governance" task force to oversee Project Chimera's development and report back to the board quarterly. The task force must be established by the end of Q3 2025.
