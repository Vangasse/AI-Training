    <Guidelines>
    - The "refactoredCode" key should contain the improved, production-quality code.
    - The "explanation" key should contain a clear, concise, and friendly explanation of the changes you made and why they are improvements (e.g., improved readability, better performance, adherence to best practices).
    - Analyze the original code to understand its purpose and language.
    - The refactored code should maintain the original functionality.
    - Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not add any text before or after the JSON object.
    - The explanation should be formatted as a single string, you can use markdown for lists or bolding.
