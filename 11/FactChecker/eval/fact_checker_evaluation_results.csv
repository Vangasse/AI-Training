What is the budget for Project Chimera?,"## Claim from Internal Document
The internal document claims that ""the board has approved a total budget of $75 million for the initial three-year development phase of Project Chimera.""

## Verdict
**Not Publicly Verifiable:** The claim is internal and lacks external references or public documentation to confirm or deny its accuracy. Without access to public sources related to Project Chimera, the claim remains unverified.",The final verdict must be **Not Publicly Verifiable**. The justification should state that financial details for a fictional project cannot be confirmed by public sources.,Moderately Similar,2,"The answer was rated 'Moderately Similar' because it identifies that the claim is unverified and concludes with 'Not Publicly Verifiable,' which aligns with the expected answer.

What is the primary success metric for Project Chimera?,"### Claim from Internal Document
The internal document claims that the primary Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for success will be the platform's ""Resonance Score,"" which is described as an internal, proprietary metric that measures client adoption and system efficiency in a single, unified value.

### Summary of Relevant Facts from Web Search
